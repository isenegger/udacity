### Project P1: Build a Portfolio Site

Copied from Udacity's *Project Overview* slide:
A responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects you will complete through the course of the Front-End Web Developer nanodegree.

This project uses the [Bootstrap CSS framework](http://getbootstrap.com/) for responsive design.
